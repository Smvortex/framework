# Web2All framework

This framework is used by almost all Web2All PHP projects. It used to be proprietary software but now it has been released to the public domain under a MIT license.

The framework is no longer actively maintained. Most likely it is only of interest if you own software created by Web2All B.V. which was built using this framework.

## What does it do ##

The base framework handles the following:

- Sending e-mail
- handling errors and notices (log or e-mail)
- logging
- configuration management
- class loading (or autoloading)
